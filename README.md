# bisos
real mode, 16 bit operating system

started off as a small project to see how small i can make a bootloader

## dependencies
nasm, qemu-system-x86

## how do i get it running
clone the repo

run `sudo apt install nasm qemu-system-x86 -y` to install dependencies and then run `source .perms` and now you can use any of the 3 scripts, `./compile.sh`, `./run.sh` and `./test.sh`

or just plug the preassembled "BisOS.img" into the repo

### note
you can add the `-r` flag to remove the files created in the compilation process

if you really want to

but i suggest atleast looking through a couple of them in a hex editor or sumn
